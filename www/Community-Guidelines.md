## Preamble: The Axioms We Hold Self-Evident as a Community

1. Community members should aim to cooperate, collaborate and build a better game through modding

2. The community cannot tolerate mods that create unfair advantages and can run on clients without the game host's consent

3. The community cannot tolerate bigoted or harmful speech or content.

4. A mod author that chooses to engage in harmful speech and to do so in connection with their mod or Thunderstore/Community presence is necessarily making the Thunderstore and our Community a platform for spreading their harmful content. If a mod author includes harmful content or links to harmful content within their mod listing, it makes our community responsible for spreading that harmful content.

5. Our community explicitly does not wish to be used as a platform for spreading harmful content

6. An author that has used our community, against our wishes, to do the above has, by their own actions, become labelled _Persona Non Grata_ and, depending on severity of the infraction, acceptable solutions range from permanent expulsion to forced reclassification as a "NSFW" mod.

# Guidelines For Uploading to our Thunderstore Community

## General Prohibitions

In keeping with our desire to foster a collaborative community, we strictly prohibit mod authors from the following:

- Purposefully introducing incompatibilities with another author's work. This may include using BepinEx's incompatibility flag.

- Purposefully damaging another author's work at runtime, especially if it creates errors or other output that can confuse users. This may also include deleting or operating on any other author's work outside of your plugin's own directory.

- Purposefully damaging the user's computer or game. This includes damaging saves, or crashing the game intentionally without it being an explicit feature of the mod. This may also include deleting or operating on any files outside of the plugin directory.

- Uploading client side enabled cheating mods or mods that grant an unfair advantage to one player to the community.

## General Upload Guidelines

When uploading a package to the community we ask that community members follow these simple guidelines:

- Make your package unique, please do not use names or icons that match existing packages or could confuse or mislead users.

- Do not mislead users about your package. Do not use misleading names or misrepresent the contents of your package. This specifically includes uploading existing packages under a new name to surprise your friends. We're sorry, but people other than your friends use our community.

## Forking an Existing Mod

{: .important}
> Even if you have the legal right to redistribute another author's work, we ask that you follow these guidelines first before uploading a fork to our community:

If the mod already exists within the Lethal Company Modding public organization, simply ask to be granted maintainer rights and get to work, great! No fork is required.

- First, try to solve any issues the mod may have with an upstream pull request. Community fragmentation is a part of modding but should be treated as a last resort

- If the mod is unmaintained and needs a maintainer, contact the original author, if possible, and see if you can be added to the listing as a collaborator. This will ensure the users of the mod will not suffer from needing to change from one dependency to another

- At this stage, if the project is appropriately licensed to allow such, a fork may be required. It is _highly_ encouraged to contact Robyn about moving the mod in question into community possession within the Lethal Company Modding Github so that it may be maintained indefinitely without changing dependency strings again.

## Unacceptable Content Policy

The Lethal Company Modding Community of the Thunderstore site defines as harmful content and prohibits the following, non-exhaustive, list of topics from appearing in the text fields of uploaded packages or links in packages:

1. The committing or participation in committing of hate, bigotry or discrimination based on any identifiable group.

    Community members will not commit nor participate in committing hate, bigotry, or discrimination acts. Nor will community members link their work to a group or person who commits or participates in committing the same. Further, community members commit to keeping any spaces they reserve for the use of developing, maintaining or promoting their community hosted content clean of the above defined hate, bigotry or discrimination acts. The community does not wish to be associated with such acts.

    > An "identifiable group" is defined for both offenses as "any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression or mental or physical disability"[^1]

    > Commission of the offense for a motive based on race, colour, birth, national or ethnic origin,
    religion or belief, sexual orientation or disability or for another comparable motive[^2]

    

2. The support of genocide or genocidal actions[^1]

    Community members will not commit nor participate in committing support of genocide or genocidal actions. Nor will community members link their work to a group or person who commits or participates in committing the same. Further, community members commit to keeping any spaces they reserve for the use of developing, maintaining or promoting their community hosted content clean of the above defined acts. The community does not wish to be associated with such.
