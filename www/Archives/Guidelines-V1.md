# Archived Guidelines (V1)

## Lethal Company Modding Community Guidelines

These guidelines were last updated on the 3rd of March, 2024 and have been made available publicly for those that cannot view them on the community Discord or otherwise require a reference.

1. Focus on the Community:
As part of the modding community for Lethal Company, our main aim is to collaborate in order to enhance the game, making it more enjoyable and engaging for everyone. Cooperation is crucial in achieving this goal. It's important for all modders to consider the community's well-being while interacting with one another. Behaviors that negatively impact the community or cause division for example: purposely making mods that are not compatible or cause another mod to output errors and confuse users, are not acceptable.

2. Keep the Player's Experience in Mind
It's essential for mod creators to recognize that some players might not be very tech-savvy. With this in mind, avoid any actions that could damage the player's experience or their computer. This means refraining from deleting any files, especially those belonging to other mods, and not deliberately causing the game to crash. These actions can cause confusion or frustration for players and should be avoided to ensure a positive gaming experience.

3. Ask Before Using Others' Work
If you want to use another person's work in your mod, first make sure you're allowed to by checking the license. If you're not sure, or just want to be nice, it's a good idea to ask the creator for permission. This act of respect will be appreciated by others in the modding community.

4. Make Your Projects Stand Out
When you're adding a package to Thunderstore, try to include unique features that help it stand out, like a distinct icon or name. This makes it easier for users to find your project without mixing it up with others. It's important that your mod is easily identifiable and clearly different from others.

5. Policy on Cheating Mods
Our community has decided through a poll not to allow certain types of cheating mods that give players unfair advantages, such as infinite sprint, unlimited health, teleporting or flying. However, mods that require the game host's approval or synchronize settings with the host to confirm that everyone in the game agrees to their use are acceptable. Any other forms of cheating enabled on an individual player's side will not be permitted by the site staff.

6. Collaboration Over Forking
We kindly request that members avoid uploading forks of mods that are currently active and maintained. If you encounter any issues with a mod, we encourage you to first attempt to work together with its maintainers to integrate changes directly. This guideline does not aim to limit creativity nor competition against well-established mods. We still fully support the creation of original competing mods. Additionally, mod authors have the option to permit others to fork their projects if they choose.

    Deciding when it's appropriate to fork a mod involves considering various factors, such as recent updates breaking the mod, the ability to contact the current maintainer, and the mod's licensing terms. There's no strict timeline for when forking is permissible, as it will vary based on each unique situation. Ultimately, it may be as simple as getting permission from the current maintainer of a mod.

Suggestions:
Think about using source control and including a GitHub link in your package. This step will greatly simplify the process for the Thunderstore team to check your package if there are any problems.
