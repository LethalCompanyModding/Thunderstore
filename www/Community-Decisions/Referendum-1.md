## Summary

{: .important}
> Unfortunately, the original text and discussion of this particular decision are spread out between The Lethal Company Modding Community, Subreddit and a poll held across several discord servers. As such, an exact copy of the decision has not been archived.

The final vote indicated the community overwhelmingly did not want client enabled cheating mods available on the community Thunderstore site.
