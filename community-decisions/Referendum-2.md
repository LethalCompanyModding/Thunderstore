# Lethal Company Community - Thunderstore Referendum on Rules and Policy no. 2

## Points of Order

- A new policy on bigotry and acceptable text content for packages posted to the Lethal Company Thunderstore Community
- An open forum for any other questions and concerns

## A suggested Policy for how to handle bigotry, hate and authors that espouse such positions

Traditionally, the Thunderstore asks communities to judge the suitability of a mod for a given community by the merits of the mod and not the actions of the Author. The Lethal Company Modding Community has made it clear that there exists a class of speech that we cannot tolerate from our mod authors and that platforming such would cause more harm both inside and outside the community. To this end, it is in the best interest of our mod authors, users and general community members to document our stance in clear and understandable terms.

### The Axioms Defining This Policy Decision

`Axiom 1`: The community cannot tolerate bigoted or harmful speech.

`Axiom 2`: A mod author that chooses to engage in harmful speech and to do so in connection with their mod or Thunderstore/Community presence is necessarily making the Thunderstore and Community a platform for spreading their harmful ideology.

`Axiom 3`: Our community explicitly does not wish to be used as a platform for spreading harmful ideology

`Axiom 4`: An author that has used our community, against our wishes, to do the above has, by their own actions, become labelled _Persona Non Grata_ and there is no acceptable solution but their expulsion.

In order to satisfy the above Axioms and keep the community safe for all users regardless of gender identity, orientation, race, nationality, gender, ethnicity, etc, our community proposes the following policy:

The Lethal Company Modding Community of the Thunderstore site prohibits the following, non-exhaustive list of topics from appearing in the text fields of our uploaded packages, and further prohibits linking to sources that permit such:

1. Hate, Bigotry or Discrimination based on any identifiable group.

    > An "identifiable group" is defined for both offences as "any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression or mental or physical disability"[^1]

    > Commission of the offence for a motive based on race, colour, birth, national or ethnic origin,
    religion or belief, sexual orientation or disability or for another comparable motive[^2]

    

2. Genocide or Support for Genocidal Actions[^1]

## Open Forum for Suggestions

Please join us for the week of June 24th to discuss the above policy and provide feedback on the status of community policy.
