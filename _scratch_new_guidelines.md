## Preamble: The Axioms We Hold Self-Evident as a Community

1. Community members should aim to cooperate, collaborate and build a better game through modding

2. The community cannot tolerate mods that create unfair advantages and can run on clients without the game host's consent

-- Insert Axioms from Ref 2 here --

# Lethal Company Modding Community Guidelines

## General Prohibitions

In keeping with our desire to foster a collaborative community, we strictly prohibit mod authors from the following:

- Purposefully introducing incompatabilities with another author's work. This may include using BepinEx's incompatability flag without a proper justification.

- Purposefully damaging another author's work at runtime, especially if it creates errors or other output that can confuse users. This may also include deleting or operating on any other author's work outside of your plugin's own directory.

- Purposefully damage the user's computer or game. This includes damaging saves, or crashing the game intentionally without it being an explicit feature of the mod. This may also include deleting or operating on any files outside of the plugin directory.

- Uploading client side enabled cheating mods to the community.

## General Upload Guidelines

When uploading a package to the community we ask that community members follow these simple guidelines:

- Make your package unique, please do not use names or icons that match existing packages or could confuse or mislead users.

- Do not mislead users about your package. Do not use misleading names or misrepresent the contents of your package. This specifically includes uploading existing packages under a new name to surprise your friends. We're sorry, but people other than your friends use our community.

## Forking an Existing Mod

Even if you have the legal right to redistribute another author's work, we ask that you follow these guidelines first before uploading a fork to our community:

If the mod already exists within the Lethal Company Modding public organization, simply ask to be granted maintainer rights and get to work, great! No fork is required.

- First, try to solve any issues the mod may have with an upstream pull request. Community fragmentation is a part of modding but should be treated as a last resort

- If the mod is unmaintained and needs a maintainer, contact the original author, if possible, and see if you can be added to the listing as a collaborator. This will ensure the users of the mod will not suffer from needing to change from one dependency to another

- At this stage, if the project is appropriately licensed to allow such, a fork may be required. It is _highly_ encouraged to contact Robin about moving the mod in question into community possession within the Lethal Company Modding Github so that it may be maintained indefinitely without changing dependency strings again.
